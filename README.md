Live demo hosted on **Vercel**  
> üîó https://bug-triage-ai-app-git-master-taursoum-3328s-projects.vercel.app/

To deploy yourself:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/Soum1989/bug_triage_ai_app.git
git push -u origin main

# Then connect to Vercel (via dashboard or CLI)

### üêû Bug Report Summary
Loan offer banner overlaps with chat input box

### üîÅ Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the chat interface on mobile
2. Scroll down to view chat messages
3. Observe the bottom area
4. Try typing a message when the banner is visible

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
Chat input should remain accessible and not hidden behind any UI element like banners

### ‚ùå Actual Behavior
Loan offer banner overlaps the chat input field, making it difficult to type messages.

### üñ•Ô∏è Affected Platform(s)
iOS

### ‚è≥ Suggested Priority
High

### üé´ Ticket ID
YPAY-1752568371908

üì¶ Export to XLSX

cd backend/
python export_bug_reports.py

üß† Inspiration
Built for streamlining bug triage during UAT cycles, sprint testing, and internal QA ‚Äî especially for AI/chatbot-based flows.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

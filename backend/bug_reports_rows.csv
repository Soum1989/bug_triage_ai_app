3. Tap on the “Upload Documents” button
4. Choose a valid document file (e.g., PDF, JPEG)
5. Attempt to upload the selected document
6. Observe whether the upload completes or fails



### ✅ Expected Behavior
The user should be able to upload a valid KYC document (PDF/JPEG) without any error.  
After selecting a file, the app should show a success confirmation (e.g., “Document uploaded successfully”) and reflect the uploaded file in the KYC status.

After selecting a valid KYC document, the upload either:
- Fails silently without any feedback
- Shows a generic error (“Upload failed. Try again.”)
